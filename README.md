## Assignment 7
In this repository, called jupyterlab_practice, I completed the following:
- Created a new GitHub repo called jupyterlab_practice and made the repo Public
- Initialized a repo with README file
- Choosed a license : MIT License
- After the repo was created, added .gitignore file and populate it with **/*.log, .DS_Store and .ipynb_checkpoint.
- Cloned the jupyterlab_practice repo to your computer
- Created a branch called developer-1
- Set up the tracking branch for your local developer-1 branch
- Used developer-1 branch to make any changes to your repo
- Published the branch on the remote
- Created an environment (you can use any name) and exported it as environment.yaml

Within this enviornment, I created two ipynb files to demonstrate my understanding of code and markdown cells within Jupyer notebooks. These were screenshotted, pushed to remote, and finally the changes were merged into main using a pull request.
